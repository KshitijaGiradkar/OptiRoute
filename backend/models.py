"""
models.py — Pydantic request/response schemas for the VRPTW optimizer API.

Why this file exists:
    FastAPI uses Pydantic models for automatic request validation, JSON
    serialisation, and OpenAPI schema generation.  Keeping models in their own
    file separates the data contract from business logic, making it easy to
    version the API or reuse these types in tests.

Types defined here:
    Request side:
        DeliveryStop          — one customer with an address + slot preference
        OptimizeRouteRequest  — full POST body (depot + list of deliveries)

    Response side:
        OptimizedStop         — one stop in the solved route (includes Maps URL)
        OptimizeRouteResponse — full response envelope
